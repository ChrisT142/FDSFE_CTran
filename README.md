ADD HERE A BRIEF STATEMENT ABOUT THIS CLASS AND YOU:

- What is the reason why you decided to take this class?
I took an interest in what data science could possibily be? I was hoping if I find that this class was of interest,
than I might look into it more as another career path way I could take, even though I'm graduating this year with
a cognitive science degree. 
- What do you hope to learn the most?
Not sure, just the basics?
- What are the strength in your background or character that you think will help you in the class?
  I have taken a intro to computer science class twice that uses python XD. I'm familar with python up until using loops
  and while statements. Hopefully I don't need to be to advanced at python to stay on track with class.
